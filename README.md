# 🌍 COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## 📌 Project Description
A data analysis project tracking global COVID-19 trends including cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across countries and time periods. The project cleans real-world data, performs exploratory analysis, and generates interactive visualizations to reveal pandemic patterns.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Import and clean COVID-19 global datasets
- Analyze time trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations)
- Compare metrics across countries/regions
- Visualize trends with interactive charts and maps
- Generate actionable insights from pandemic data

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
```python
- Python 3.8+
- Pandas (Data manipulation)
- Plotly (Interactive visualizations)
- Jupyter Notebook (Analysis environment)
- Conda (Package management)
```

## 🔍Key Insights
Vaccination Impact: Countries with early vaccination campaigns showed 60-75% faster case decline

Regional Patterns: Southeast Asia experienced delayed but sharper waves compared to Europe

Mortality Correlation: Case fatality rates correlated strongly with healthcare capacity metrics

Wave Timing: Southern/Northern hemisphere countries showed inverse seasonality patterns
